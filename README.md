## RStudio Code Instructions:

1. Create a new project or load the included files found in `/p2_shiny`
2. Ensure that both the `atlantic_data.rds` and `pacific_data.rds` files are in the same directory as the project
3. Copy or load the code file 'app.R' and click the Run button
4. If RStudio gives issues, install the necessary packages it may prompt you for
5. Otherwise, go to the RStudio package manager and install the packages by name as seen in the library list at the top of 'app.R'
6. Click the Run button
7. If RStudio prompts you for a Shiny account, make and connect one using [this tutorial](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/)
8. The visualization should be up and running and ready to be used
9. The application works best on 32:9 aspect ratio displays so stretch the windows as wide as you can (or use development tools in your browser to simulate different resolutions if running from the browser)

## Jupiter Notebook Code Instructions:

1. Load the included '.ipynb' file into Jupyter Notebook ([using Anaconda with an R environment](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/r-lang/))
2. Ensure that both the `hurdat2-1851-2018-120319.txt` and `hurdat2-nepac-1949-2018-122019.txt` files are in the same directory as the notebook file
3. Install the necessary packages 
4. Select the top cell of the notebook file and click the Run button
5. Observe outputs from each cell and continue to click run for each cell
